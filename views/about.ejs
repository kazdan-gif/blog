      <h1>Alon — SMB Automation Specialist</h1>
      <p>I build AI-powered automation solutions for small and medium businesses. My testing ground is <strong>Merital</strong>, our family business for water purification, where I design and deploy real-world systems that solve operational problems — from lead management to reputation monitoring.</p>
      <p>I believe that the same tools powering enterprise automation — LLMs, workflow orchestration, cloud APIs — are accessible to any business willing to think systematically about its processes. My goal is to prove it, one case study at a time.</p>

      <h2>The Merital Lab</h2>
      <p>Merital is where every solution gets battle-tested. If it works for a one-person field operation running from a van, it works anywhere. Each project on this site started as a real problem we needed to solve — not a demo.</p>
