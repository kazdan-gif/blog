# Welcome to My Blog

Thanks for stopping by! This blog is powered by **Express** and **Markdown** files — no database required.

## How it works

Each post is a `.md` file in the `posts/` directory with YAML frontmatter for metadata:

```yaml
---
title: My Post Title
date: 2026-01-29
excerpt: A short summary.
---
```

To add a new post, just create a new markdown file and deploy.

## What's next

Stay tuned for more posts!
